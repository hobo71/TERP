                    <p>If you identify some damage with the Europcar agent or representative when you return the vehicle, you can acknowledge the damage by signing the Statement of Return of the Vehicle. Europcar will then provide you with an invoice describing the repair costs plus an administration fee for the treatment of the Damage and the Vehicle immobilization that will be charged to you. 
 
Repair costs vary depending on the type of damage:
→ Light damage, insubstantial damage which does not affect the safe driving of the vehicle, such as scratches; light impacts on windshield, scratches on bumpers: Charges are made based on the Europcar Recommended price list available in any Europcar station. 
→ More substantial damage impairing the use of the vehicle and requiring its temporary immobilization, such as bodywork damage. This type of damage will be evaluated by an independent expert and charged according to the expert’s report or a cost estimation made by an independent auto-repair garage.
 
If you contest the damages and decide not to sign the statement of return of the Vehicle, Europcar will apply the procedure described below (see the section 2).</p>

If the Europcar Agent or representative identifies some damage when they inspect the vehicle after you have finished the rental and departed, Europcar will send you the following documents:
- Statement of return of the Vehicle describing all damages identified
- Pictures of Damages
- An estimate of the repair costs that will vary depending of the type of damage (see above) plus an administration fee for the treatment of the damage and the Vehicle immobilization.
 
If you wish to contest the damage identified or the cost of repair, you should contact us by email or letter within 14 days of the documents being sent. At the end of this 14 day period, Europcar may invoice you for the repair cost and administration fee..

abnormal use: means that your use of the Vehicle whilst you are in charge of it doesn’t comply with the Road Traffic laws that prevail and/or does not meet with the requirements of the Local Rental terms and conditions and/or does not meet with the standards of driving that would be expected of a reasonable and prudent driver
 
Accident Report (“declaration d’accident”): means a full and complete signed statement (including any other document(s)) which records all of the facts of an accident or incident as they occurred (for example, how the event occurred, the nature of the damage to the Vehicle, the location where the incident took place, the dates and circumstances and any potential witness details)

Bodily Injury (or bodily injury) means any physical injury suffered by a person that is caused as the direct result of an accident; it is not something that is intentionally self-inflicted and it does not result from sickness or disease
 
Book value: means the value that a Vehicle is recorded to be worth to us on our books at the time of the incident.
 
Collision means the impact of the Vehicle with another fixed or moving body or object
 
Excess amount is a specified sum of money that, provided you have complied with the Local Rental terms and conditions and have not committed a breach of any applicable laws, is the maximum amount we will charge you for the cost of any damage caused to the Vehicle as a result of a collision during the rental period or its attempted theft; or the loss of a Vehicle if it is written off because it is irreparable or if it is stolen and we do not get it back. The Excess amount is a non-waivable sum that is governed by the conditions of the protection product you have purchased.
 
Local Rental terms and conditions means the document you acknowledge that you have read and approved when you sign your rental agreement and which sets out the rights and obligations that will apply to both you and us throughout the rental period
 
Loss of Use describes the circumstances where a Vehicle is unavailable for us to rent to another customer because, as a result of a collision during the rental period it was damaged and we need to take it off the road to have it repaired
 
Passenger means any person other than the driver that is being transported or is travelling in or on the Vehicle on a gratuitous basis. A Passenger would be viewed as a Third Party under the mandatory Third Party Liability insurance regimes
 
Protection (or protection) in this document applies to the means by which your financial liability for any damage to or loss of a Vehicle is limited to the Excess amount.
 
Third Party means any party to an incident – other than the driver of the Vehicle. For the avoidance of doubt a Passenger is deemed to be a Third Party
 
Third Party Liability insurance means insurance that provides the driver of a Vehicle with protection against liability for another party’s claims for damage to his/her property or for bodily injury or death arising out of an incident arising whilst you are using the Vehicle. Third Party Cover is a mandatory legal requirement and it is therefore an integral part of our rental service. The cost of it is included in the rental charge.
 
Vehicle means the vehicle you will be renting from us or you will be driving with our authorization.
 
We or we/ Us or us / Ours or ours means Europcar
 
You or you / Yours or yours means any named driver</p>

                    <a name = "t3s2"></a>
                    <p>We are mandated by the laws of all of the countries in which we operate our vehicle rental services to insure our Vehicles against liability for the claims or actions of Third Parties. We have purchased the best Third Party Liability insurance from the foremost insurers in the business and it is automatically included as part of our vehicle rental services. You will therefore, as a matter of course, be covered up to the level legally required by the country in which you are renting the Vehicle for the consequences others may suffer as a direct result of your actions whilst you are driving the Vehicle.
 
What am I covered for?
 
As provided by law you will be insured against liability for the financial cost of any of the following consequences that may arise as a result of an incident that you cause when you are using the Vehicle:
 
• bodily injury or death suffered by Third Parties; and
• property damage sustained by Third Parties and losses and costs arising as a consequence of the damage.
 
What is excluded from the cover?
 
Third Party Liability insurance does not cover:
 
• bodily injury or death that you (the driver at the time of the collision) may suffer; or
• any damage to or loss of your personal property or possessions; or
• any damage caused to the Vehicle
 
What is the amount of my financial exposure for Third Party Liability?
 
Provided you have not committed a breach of any applicable laws (including any relevant road traffic regulations) then you will be covered for the financial cost of any Third Party Liability arising as the result of a collision that you may cause whilst you are driving the Vehicle up to the level legally required by the country in which you are renting the Vehicle.
 
However, if you didn’t comply with those laws and/or regulations then, whilst our insurer will still fulfil its obligations to Third Parties under the Third Party Liability insurance policy, it may seek to recover from you some or all of the costs it may have paid to that Third Party as a result of the incident.
 
How to notify us?
 
In circumstances involving Third Parties it is important that you do your utmost to properly complete and sign an Accident Report (“Constat d’accident”) form which gives us all relevant details of both the incident and of the Third Party. This will allow us to defend our case against the Third Party (if you are responsible for the incident) or to recover costs from the Third Party (if the Third Party is responsible for the incident).

C. Deposit - Transaction authorisation

During Your booking and at time of "Check-out":

During your booking and at time of "Check-out", You will be informed that in addition to the price of your rental, You will be asked to leave a deposit. The amount of the deposit will be mentioned before the finalization of your booking, restated in your booking confirmation email and also on the Rental Agreement that You will receive at the rental station at time of check-out. The deposit takes the form of an electronic pre-authorization taken on Your credit- card (the "Deposit").

This Deposit allows Europcar to secure the final transaction amount as Europcar will receive the protection of an authorization before the start of the rental period. It also confirms that Your bank account is valid and within the available spending limit.

Warning: Amount of deposit depends on the local policy of the "Check out" station(s) and may vary from one country to another.

For more information on the method of calculation of the deposit, please click here.

Please note however that, from a general perspective, the Deposit amount covers the vehicle rental agreement period as well as any extra   charges that may incurred during your rental. For any further information on the coverage of the deposit, please refer to the Terms and Conditions of Hire of your country of rental, by clicking here and selecting your country of rental.

The amount of the Deposit stays valid for the length of the rental agreement period. For rental agreements longer than thirty (30) days, a new authorization for each additional period of rental will be requested by Europcar from the card holder's bank account.

At time of "Check-in":

If the final charged amount for the car rental services rendered is below the Deposit amount at time of "check-out" then an additional authorization may be requested to cover the amount due.</p>
